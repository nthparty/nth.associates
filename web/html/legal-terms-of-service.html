    <h2>1. THE SERVICE</h2>
    <p>The Service is our web-based private data collaboration tool. Sometimes you just want to know if you and your counterpart at another company have any data in common in your respective lists -- whether these are customer lists, product offerings, purchase histories, and so on -- so that you can identify new partnership opportunities and decide whether you want to work together. To use the Service, each entity populates a spreadsheet and retrieves a code from the browser to encrypt it, and then uploads the encrypted spreadsheet. The uploaded data is referred to as the "User Data".</p>
    <p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service; create usage limits for the Service; or permanently or temporarily suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason.</p>
    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service solely for your internal business purpose as permitted by the features of the Service. We may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>
    <p>You agree to use the Service only in compliance with these Terms of Service and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations
    <p>You shall not (a) modify the Service, (b) reverse compile, reverse assemble, reverse engineer or otherwise translate all or any portion of the Service, (c) pledge, rent, lease, share, distribute, sell or create derivative works of the Service; (d) use Service or other similar basis; (e) make copies of the Service; (f) circumvent or disable any copyright protection mechanism or license management mechanism in connection with the Service; (g) use the Service in violation of any applicable law; (h) use the Service to violate any rights of any third party or to decrypt any data or (i) upload any unencrypted date to the Service.</p>
    <p>As between you and us, we own all right, title and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in the Service, inclusive of any infrastructure, know-how, and source code used to provide the Service. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
    <p>By submitting, posting, uploading, displaying, transferring, inputting, providing, or otherwise making available any User Data on or through the Service, you hereby grant, and represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, all rights and licenses to the User Data for us to provide, improve and enhance the Service.</p>

    <p>Neither party shall assign or otherwise transfer these Terms of Service or any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether by operation of law or otherwise, to any third party without the other partyâ€™s prior written consent. Any purported transfer, assignment or delegation without such prior written consent will be null and void and of no force or effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to assign these Terms of Service to any successor to its business or assets to which these Terms of Service relate, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock, reorganization or otherwise. Subject to this Section, these Terms of Service shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>

    <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
